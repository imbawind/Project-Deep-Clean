# Project Deep Clean
A new project is created for the DevBase ROM in the repo [here](https://github.com/ycsin/DevBase-OneUI-Lite).
------------
Since Samsung TouchWiz ROM is extremely bloated with features. Project Deep Clean is aimed to provide a comprehensive removable list with descriptions so that we can completely remove useless ~~features~~ and files that we don't need without breaking the functionalities that we actually want to use.
